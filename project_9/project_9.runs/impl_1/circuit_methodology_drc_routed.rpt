There is a large setup violation of -5.714 ns between automate/c_reg[2]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and automate/K_reg[16][15][0]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#996 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.718 ns between automate/c_reg[2]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and automate/K_reg[13][4][5]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
